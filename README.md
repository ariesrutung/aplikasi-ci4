Memulai Aplikasi Codeigniter 4

1. Install Composer
2. Install Git Bash
3. Git bash here in the directory where the app will install
4. run command (mode install via composer)

```
$ composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter nama_project project-root
```
replace *nama_project* with the real project name

or

```
$ composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter nama_project --no-dev
```

if found errors

```
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - codeigniter4/framework[4.0.0, ..., v4.4.5] require ext-intl * -> it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's intl extension.
    - Root composer.json requires codeigniter4/framework ^4.0 -> satisfiable by codeigniter4/framework[4.0.0, ..., v4.4.5].

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
    - G:\xampp-7_4_30\php\php.ini
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-intl` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
Running update with --no-dev does not mean require-dev is ignored, it just means the packages will not be installed. If dev requirements are blocking the update you have to resolve those problems.

```

Solution:
Open [xampp_folder_path]/php/php.ini to edit.
Search for ;extension=intl and remove the ;.
Save the php.ini file and restart Apache.

# Install MPDF
```
$ composer require mpdf/mpdf
```

run the command inside the directory where the ci4 app installed
